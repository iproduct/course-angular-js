## Angular 2
As you might know, Angular 2 is right around the corner. Be aware that this starter kit will soon be deprecated.

Note that this starter kit is derived from the Angular 2 Starter Kit: https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter

## Status and roadmap
Check out the issues/labels & milestones to get an idea of what's next. For existing features, refer to the previous section.

## Installation
First of all, make sure that you have installed NodeJS & npm: https://nodejs.org/en/.

Two approaches:
* clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/dsebastien/angularjs-webpack-starter.git`
* download a zip: https://github.com/dsebastien/angularjs-webpack-starter/archive/master.zip

Now you can download all the necessary dependencies using the setup script: `npm run setup`.

Finally, you can start the development server using `npm start`.

Check out the scripts section below for more information about the available commands.

## Upgrade
Check out the [upgrade](UPGRADE.MD) page

## Scripts
* `npm run setup`: install required global dependencies and project dependencies
* `npm start`: start the development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and live reloading
* `npm run start:hmr`: start the development server with Hot Module Replacement enabled but without live reloading (e.g., no automatic reload when stylesheets change)
* `npm run start:hmr:livereload`: start the development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and live reloading
* `npm run build:prod`: build the production version (in /dist)
* `npm run start:prod`: build and serve the production version
* `npm run profiling`: generate Webpack profiling information under `reports/profiling`. The stats.json file can be uploaded to http://webpack.github.io/analyse/ for analysis
* `npm test`: run unit tests
* `npm run test-subset src/?`: run a subset of the unit tests where ? is either a specific file or a folder. Only tests matching the given path will be executed. The given path MUST start with src/. The file name (if any specified) MUST contain the file extension
  * example: `npm run test-subset src/app/tests/sanity_test_spec.ts`
* `npm run e2e`: run end to end tests
* `npm run e2e:live`: run end to end tests in debug mode: https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/debugging.md
* `npm run ci`: run unit tests and integration tests
* `npm run clean`: clean generated folders and files
* `npm run clean:all`: clean + remove installed TypeScript type definitions + npm clean
* `npm run clean:dist`: only clean the dist folder
* `npm run clean:install`: clean all + remove installed node_modules + install
* `npm run clean:start`: clean + start the development server
* `npm run docs`: generate documentation
* `npm run lint`: lint TypeScript code
* `npm run outdated`: check for outdated dependencies
* `npm run superstatic`: starts the production server (assumes that you've executed `npm run build:prod` before)
* `npm run tsc`: run the TypeScript compiler
* `npm run typings-install`: install TypeScript type definitions using typings
* `npm run watch`: start the development webpack build in watch mode
* `npm run watch:prod`: start the production webpack build in watch mode
* `npm run watch:test`: start the test webpack build in watch mode
* `npm run watch:test-subset`: start the test webpack build in watch mode and filter the tests to execute (see npm test)
* `npm run watch:testd`: start the test webpack build in watch mode with debugging enabled
* `npm run webdriver:start`: start the Webdriver Manager
* `npm run webdriver:update`: update Webdriver

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
### Proxy
If you are behind a corporate proxy, you should ensure that your configuration allows you to work correctly.

First, you should be able to configure the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` in your environment so that all CLI tools (e.g., git, typings, ...) can go through the proxy.

Don't forget to also define the `NO_PROXY` variable to avoid going through the proxy for local resources (e.g., localhost, local domains, etc).

Note that the .typingsrc file is there to avoid issues caused by SSL termination that is often done in corporate environments. Note that the configuration we provide is INSECURE as it just disables certificate checks. Rather, you should adapt the .typingsrc configuration file so that it continues to check the certificate chain but accepts self-signed certificates generated by your company. Refer to the documentation of typings for more details about the possibilities: https://github.com/typings/typings

If the above does not work in your case, then check to make sure that the user agents are allowed through the proxy. Some corporate environments filter Web access to specific user agents (e.g., IE). The following user agents should be allowed through:
* npm/
* node/
* git/
* typings/

### Production server
The production server that you can start via `npm run server:prod` uses Superstatic (https://github.com/firebase/superstatic).
It is configured via `superstatic.json` to enable support for push-state (HTML 5 mode)
